# dotfiles
Produced By: shpurk

This is a collection of dotfiles I find myself attached to and using! 

Dangerous way of adding dotfiles:
`ln -s -f ~/dotfiles/.* ~/`

UPDATE (2015-12-25):
Right now I just have my vimrc stored here. (primarily coding in C/C++ and python).

UPDATE (2016-08-29):
Added git configurations - see commit log from same day.
